# Osmosis-Visualizer
This is the start of something great! (hopefully) I will make an **Osmosis Visualizer**! 

Learn and interact with a web site that demonstrates the concept of **osmosis**, which is the **movement of water** from a region of **high** water potential **to** a region of **lower** water potential across a **semipermeable membrane**. Think diffusion but for particles in water!
